# Wade Watts

Wade Owen Watts is the main character in the novel Ready Player One. Born in a near furture he is living a poor and boring life as most other humans doin a world depleted of natural ressources, led by large corporations rather than states like the old states. 
But then you get another character, his alter ego Parzival. This character lives his preferred second life in a vast virtual reality, where a bounty for true richness and power over that virtual world is open for any human player on earth.
 That quest also shaped his character to be a skillful player and connoiseur of the 1980s culture. A honest knight on the quest for nothing less than the holy grail of the 21st century. He solved all the quests and found all the bonuses levels in each and every notable piece of gaming from that decade on his own. 
So for him, in contrast to his adversaries from IOI corporation, cheating is no option at all. IOI cheat0rz, all your base are belong to us!
